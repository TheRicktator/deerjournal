			<h2>Leading Up To Season</h2>

				<p>It's now September of 2022, youth season opens in exactly 10 days so we are getting prepared.  We have zeroed in on a piece of Goosepond called BeeHunter Bottoms, this specific area I call Treeline.  We've sat a trailcam on a hot trail and have already gotten pictures of a mature doe and a young 8 point buck.  Below are some of the pictures:</p>

				<p>Driving home from our main spot we noticed a nice trail around baseline road, checked it, added a camera and have already caught several deer including a giant old doe, and a nice 6 point buck.  I call this place Oak Grove.</p>

	
			<h3>Trail-cam Photos</h3>

				<p>Here are some of the best trailcam photos I have gotten so far.  We've also gotten a bobcat, coyote, a fox, raccoons and a flock of turkeys.</p>

			<h3>Target Practice</h3>

				<p>We now have a scope for our crossbow, and with youth season opening up in 9 days we're going to take it out tonight for some target practice.  Here's how we shot, going from 20 to 50 yards.</p>

				<ul class="target">
					<li>20 yards: Uhh pretty crap... arrows kept hitting the ground and ricocheting into the target (or out into the bean field) but luckily we found the sight for the muzzleloader, so we'll use the muzzleloader for youth weekend and keep practicing with the crossbow.</li>
					<li>30 yards: N/A technicaaaaa difffuculttttie</li>
					<li>40 yards: N/A ur trash kid lol</li>
					<li>50 yards: N/A didn't get past 20 lol</li>
				</ul> <!--End of Target Practice-->

		<h2>Deer Season</h2>

			<p>Here is how each hunt from the 2022 season went, including youth season, archery, firearms and muzzleloader seasons.</p>

		<div id = "youth season">

			<h3>Youth Season, September 24-25</h3>
		
				<p>Youth season has opened, and we're going to hunt atleast twice during the weekend long season using our trailcam footage as a guide; one or two does and a small buck usually pass by this trail around 7am, and we plan to ambush them.</p>

				<p>(Update from 9/16/22) looks like a small cold front will be moving in on youth weekend with the highs being 74 and 75.</p>

				<p>(Update from 9/23/22) After seeing even more trail camera footage, we have 2 young bucks, a small 8 point and a 4 point, and several does.  They all move throughout sunrise and some does are even moving around in the evening around 7-8.</p>	
		
			<h3>Youth Season Hunts</h3>

				
					<h4>September 24th</h4>
					
					<ol>
						<li>Treeline (BH3), morning of September 24th, 2022: Saw 2 deer; one as we pulled in and one while we were hunting, I actually got a shot off at one but due to either a gun malfunction or aiming too high, I didn't hit or kill it.</li>
						<li>Oak Grove (BH5N), evening of September 24th, 2022: Didn't see anything but possibly heard a buck grunt, but the high was around 80 so that could've ruined deer movement.</li>
					</ol> <!--End of September 24th-->

					<h4>September 25th</h4>
					
					<ol>
						<li>Treeline (BH3), morning of September 25th, 2022: Our hunt was ruined due to a storm moving in around 6:30, we opted to head home and get more sleep than to get struck by lightning.</li>
						<li>Oak Grove (BH5N), evening of September 25th, 2022: Didn't lay eyes on any deer, but we heard a doe bleat, and heard a deer moving around in front of us, we just couldn't see it</li>
					</ol> <!--End of September 25th-->
					
					<p>Even though we didn't kill one, youth season was a success.  We saw two, had non visual interactions, we know two great areas, and have two different nice bucks on camera + a giant old doe.  Can't wait for archery season!</p>

					<h4>We were not able to hunt till sunset during youth season due to the processor closing at 7pm.</h4>

			<h3>Archery Season, October 1st-January 1st</h3>

				<p>After not getting a deer in youth season, we're getting ready for archery season starting October 1st.</p>

			<h3>Target Practice Take 2</h3>

				<p>We decided to take the scope off of the crossbow, and get it sighted in with just old-fashioned iron sights. We took it out September 27th, and here's how we did:</p>

			<ul class="target">
				<li>10 yards: 1 shot, easy bullseye</li>

				<li>20 yards: After a few shots and some sight adjustments I was getting bullseyes easy</li>

				<li>30 yards: I was even getting bullseyes out at 30 yards.</li>
			</ul> <!--End of Target Practice 2-->

			<p>We did great with iron sights! I'm more than ready for opening day of archery season.</p>

			<h3>Archery Season Hunts</h3>

				<h4>October 1st, 2022</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Oak Grove, (BH5N), morning of October 1st, 2022: Didn't lay eyes on any deer, but did have one deer spook either because of us or something else; we heard it blow very near us, and run off blowing several times.  After that the morning went quiet. </li>
					<li>Oak Grove, (BH5N), afternoon/evening of October 1st, 2022: Sat from about 2pm to 7:15 and didn't see or hear any deer.  
				</ol> <!--End of October 1st-->

				<h3>On October 6th we added some blind material at Oak Grove to help conceal us when we're hunting.</h3>

				<h4>October 7th, 2022</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Oak Grove, (BH5N), evening of October 7th, 2022: Got sat up around 4pm and sat till around 7. At roughly 5:10 we spotted a mature doe with a yearling doe behind us and to our left about 15 yards.  When they came to the trail, they had to choose to turn left (which would take them away from us into an overgrown field) or to take the trail right (which was my shooting lane).  They opted to go left into the field, still an amazing hunt though, we're getting so close to getting one.</li>
				</ol> <!--End of October 7th-->
				
				<h4>Due to a heat wave and Dad's serious back injury putting up a trail camera, we weren't able to hunt till Oct. 7th.</h4>

				<h4>October 9th, 2022</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Oak Grove, (BH5N), Afternoon - part of the evening of October 9th, 2022: Went out earlier, around 2pm to 6.  Didn't see anything, did hear some possible footsteps but nothing definite.  Could be due to a heat wave coming through.</li>
				</ol> <!--End of October 9th-->

				<h3>Update: Due to getting several good deer including big bucks on camera at Oak Grove, and some idiot driving a car around Treeline every night, Oak Grove has become our main hunting area.</h3>

				<h4>October 12th, 2022</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Oak Grove, (BH5N), Evening of October 12th, 2022: Sat up around 4:00pm till sunset.  Didn't see anything, heard a couple sounds but nothing definite.</li>
				</ol> <!--End of October 12th-->

				<h4>October 13th, 2022</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Treeline, (B53), Evening of October 13th, 2022: Got sat up as usual around 4:00 till sunset, didn't see anything, but super high winds, and several other hunters on our camera could be part of the problem.  We're contemplating leaving Treeline for a while and focusing on Oak Grove, and possibly trying to find another spot.</li>
				</ol> <!--End of October 13th-->

				<h4>October 15th, 2022</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Oak Grove, (BH5N), Morning of October 15th, 2022: Morning hunt, got out around 6:30 and hunted till around 10.  Heard sounds but nothing definite, Dad said he saw some movement a little before sunrise but not sure if it was a deer or not.  During our hunting time we had atleast 2 does on camera 100 yards away, we just weren't in the right spot.</li>
				</ol> <!--End of October 15th-->

				<h4>October 17th, 2022</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Treeline, (BH3), First half of the morning of October 17th, 2022: Sat up around 6:30, saw a nice little buck cross the road in front of us about 150-200 yards away from our hunting place.  Around 7:20 I caught movement but couldn't tell if it was a deer or not, after a few seconds a deer blew then jumped into the weeds and ran off.  I thought I heard a couple more run off with it.  We think they saw my crossbow, so we adjusted our spot a few feet to be more concealed.</li>
					<li>Oak Grove, (BH5N), Second half of the morning of October 17th, 2022: We waited about an hour after those deer spooked at Treeline and decided to try at Oak Grove, we tried a new spot but it wasn't concealed enough so we went back to the blind.  Sat till about 10:00 and didn't see any deer, but did see our friend the massive squirrel.</li>
				</ol> <!--End of October 17th-->
			
				<h3>Massive update from October 17th: We have secured permission to hunt at Poppy's Shop, around 27 acres of private land that includes a hay field.  We're heading out on the 18th to scout around and hopefully put out a couple trail cameras</h3>

				<h4>October 18th, 2022</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>The Shop, afternoon of October 18th, 2022: Went out to scout around the Shop, saw several trails leading into and around the hayfield, and even saw some rubs, one of which was fresh from this year.  We're still waiting to get permission to put trail-cameras out.</li>
				</ol> <!--End of October 18th-->

				<h4>October 19th, 2022</h4> 
				<ol>
					<li>Treeline, (BH3), Morning of October 19th, 2022: Same time, sat up around 6:30 and just like clockwork at 7:20 2 deer came in, one walked perfectly into my shooting lane and I gave it a "Baap" to stop it; ready to fire.  but instead of stopping it just immediately trotted off, along with the 2nd deer.  We're getting so close, just really hoping it happens this year.</li>
				</ol> <!--End of October 19th-->

				<h3>(October 20th) We took both cameras out of Oak grove and sat them up at The Shop, one over a fresh buck rub and one over the field in the corner, near the hidden pond.</h3>

				<h4>October 21st, 2022</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>Treeline, (BH3), Morning of October 21st, 2022: Sat up at the same time (6:30), and sat till around 8:30.  The high was much higher than the last few days (42 degrees) and we saw no deer.  It also could be due to the fact that we heard several dogs and coyotes going off all morning.</li>
				</ol> <!--End of October 21st-->

				<h3>(October 26th) Dad recovered the cameras from The Shop, I wasn't able to help due to me having a stomach bug.  We got a ton of good deer on camera, here are some of the highlights:</h3>

				<img src = "./photos/shop/1.jpg" alt = "Sideview of a possible 10 point at 9:17pm" height = 510 width = 825/>
				<img src = "./photos/shop/2.jpg" alt = "Front view of the possible 10 point, showing off his nearly torn off right ear" height = 510 width = 825 />

				<h3>Bonus picture of a screaming deer:</h3>

				<img src = "./photos/shop/screaming.jpg" alt = "Zoom-up of a screaming doe." height = 510 width = 825 /> <!--End of October 26th-->

				<h3>November 3rd, 2022</h3> <!--End of November 3rd-->
				
				<p>We went out to The Shop to check cameras today after work, once we got home to check the SD cards we figured out one of the cameras was out of battery.  So we went back out to change the batteries in both cameras, and also removed the blind material from Oak Grove and moved it to the field hoping to get the deer herd used to seeing a blind.  We also checked Orscheln and Walmart for ground blinds we're considering using.</p>

				<h3>November 6th, 2022</h3> <!--End of November 6th-->

				<p>We went out today to set up a blind at The Shop and to check trail cameras, we got the blind set up in a great spot, then checked the cameras and got a massive half blind old buck, looks like he could possibly be a 14-point.</p>

				<img src = "./photos/shop/11 3 2010.jpg" alt = "Massive half blind 14 point, side view at 8:10pm" height = 510 width = 825 />
				<img src = "./photos/shop/11 5 2133 3.jpg" alt = "Massive half blind 14 point, front view, at 9:33pm." height = 510 width = 825 />

				<h4>November 7th, 2022</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>The Shop, evening of November 7th, 2022: Sat up at our blind around 4pm, due to the time change we were only able to hunt till around 6.  Didn't see any deer, but we did see two different flocks of turkeys, 3 ducks, and some squirrels.</li>
				</ol> <!--End of November 7th-->

			<div id = "firearms"> <!--Beginning of firearms season-->

			<h3>Firearms season hunts</h3>
				
				<p>Firearms season has opened, and I'll be taking my 20 guage shotgun loaded with slugs in hopes to finally kill a deer.</p>

				<h4>November 12th, 2022</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>The Shop/Greene Sullivan, morning of November 12th, 2022: It's opening day of firearms season, and we wanted to try our luck with a morning hunt.  We got sat up before sunrise at the shop, but before legal hunting time another hunter walked past us.  We have no clue whether he was a poacher or not, but we decided to cut out early and not get shot.  We went to our old Greene Sullivan spot for an hour or so but never saw anything.</li>
					<li>The Shop, evening of November 12th, 2022: After a terrible morning we decided to try an evening hunt.  Got out early at around 1:30, and at 3:15 we saw a buck cruising the opposite end of the field.  He didn't offer us a great shot, as he stuck to the woodline.  Now about 5:20 two does came out into the field perfectly, but the bigger doe caught sight of us, and I opted not to take a frontal shot, and they spooked off.</li>
				</ol>

				<h4>November 13th, 2022</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>The Shop, afternoon/evening of November 13th, 2022: We got out early, around 11 or 12.  We even ate lunch out at the blind.  Around 4 or 5 we heard a doe blowing off in the woods off and on for a while, we could tell she was moving around but we didn't know why.  I caught sight of two deer in the woodline but never was offered a shot, we believe a buck was chasing her.</li>
				</ol>

				<h4>November 16th, 2022</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>The Shop, evening of November 16th, 2022:  After Dad and Mom got back from work we decided to try our luck tonight even though it was pretty windy, we didn't hunt at our blind due to the fact that the deer would be downwind of us.  We sat up about 20 feet to the right of our original camera.  We saw several turkeys walk past us, but weren't sure if we'd see any deer due to the wind.  At about 5:25 I caught movement out of the corner of my eye, and saw a buck heading straight for us.  He turned perfectly broadside, and I shot.  He hopped into the woods, and we quickly went over to see if we got him.  We saw him standing about 20 yards down the hill, obviously injured, so I ran over and got the shotgun and put another slug in him.  We got him!!</li>
				</ol>

				<h1>First deer:</h1>
					
					<p>After 3 years of hunting I finally got my first buck on November 16th, I'm so excited and so thankful, God is so good!  He's a massive 9 pointer, tall but wide, and with some character.  We're gonna get him mounted, and I can't wait to get his cape back.  It's been an amazing season.</p>

				<p>We're scheduled to get the meat back in a couple weeks.</p>
